# QUADCOPTER
We make a QUADCOPTER by using 4 brushless motor with 4 propellers. We control the speed of motor by using Electronic Speed Controller (ESC). ESC will connected with a APM. We give power by using a 4s battery. We control the DRONE by a 6 channel receiver which will be connected with a 6 channel remote controller. For security we also use a voltage checker which will give alarm when the battery voltage will low during flying.
